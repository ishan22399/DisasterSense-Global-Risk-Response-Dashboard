## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Local Development

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ishan22399/DisasterSense-Global-Risk-Response-Dashboard.git
    cd DisasterSense-Global-Risk-Response-Dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    # or
    yarn install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your API keys to this file (replace `your_key_here` with your actual keys):
        ```
        AQICN_API_KEY=your_aqicn_key_here
        OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key_here
        NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
        ```

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev

    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üåê Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**, the platform built by the creators of Next.js.

1.  **Push to Git**: Ensure your project is pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  **Connect to Vercel**:
    *   Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    *   Import your Git repository.
    *   Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables on Vercel**:
